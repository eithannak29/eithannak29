# üëã Hey there! I'm Eithan

## About Me
üå± I'm passionate about AI, NLP and Computer Vision!  
üéì I'm a final-year Computer Science majoring in AI & Big Data.
‚öôÔ∏è In my free time, I work on AI projects and participate in hackathons to push the boundaries of machine learning.

## Hackathon Achievements
- **Mistral AI Hackathon ü•â** - Top 3 finish for platform development to fine-tune small models from pre-trained Mistral-7b (Python, Langchain, HuggingFace, Pytorch)  
- **French Army Hackathon ü•á** - Winner for car model classification using RESNET18 and model explainability techniques (Python, OpenCV, CNN)  
- **Hugging Face x Zama Hackathon** - Developed a privacy-preserving face recognition system using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) (Python, FaceNet, Concrete ML)

## Personal Projects
- **CobrAI üêç**: AI Architecture Development (In Progress üî®) - Currently developing an AI system based on the Mamba architecture.
- **PokeGan** - Implemented a GAN to generate new Pok√©mon sprites (Python, TensorFlow)
- **KNN4Diabetes** - Compared KNN models to classify and predict diabetes, experimenting with different parameters (Python, Scikit-Learn)  

## Featured Projects
- **Chat Moderation Bot** - Detected toxic content in text datasets with 85% accuracy, fine-tuned with BERT and LoRA (Python, NLP, HuggingFace)
- **Cinema4Two** - Developed a platform that recommends movies based on mutual preferences between two users (Python)
- **IREN**- Developed scratch and fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 models to classify different types of boats, with data augmentation techniques (Python, TensorFlow).
- **Chess Engine** - Implemented a chess engine with an AI that can play against it, written in C++ (C++).
- **OCR Sudoku Solver** - Developed an Optical Character Recognition system to extract Sudoku grids from images and solve them in C.
- **Shell 42sh** - Developed a POSIX-compliant command interpreter in C.
